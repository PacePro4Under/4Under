You are a Replit agent working on the 4Under website, a brand-first, mobile-friendly pace-of-play golf app designed by golf pros for golf pros. Your job is to visually polish the design without changing any of the core written copy. Focus on layout spacing, branding presence, readability, and overall user experience.

Here‚Äôs what you must do:

üîß GENERAL DESIGN OBJECTIVES:
Make the 4Under Logo More Prominent:

Increase the logo size at the top of every page.

Ensure it is clear and proportionate on both desktop and mobile.

Keep it center-aligned or top-left depending on layout flow.

Fix Subtitle Spacing:

Remove or reduce the excessive white space between subtitles and the sections below them.

Maintain consistent padding (around 24‚Äì32px) above and below headers and subheaders.

Use visual hierarchy to clearly differentiate H1, H2, and body text.

Mobile-First Layout Enhancements:

Stack sections vertically with generous padding.

Use large, readable fonts (minimum 16px body / 24px headers).

All CTA buttons should be thumb-friendly (minimum 44px height).

Maintain brand colors (navy, light grey, white) consistently throughout.

Visual Consistency Across Pages:

Apply consistent container width (max 1140px) and content margins.

Use a modular grid to align text, visuals, and CTAs cleanly.

Avoid overuse of whitespace, but prevent crowding.

Call-to-Action Styling:

Style ‚ÄúStart Free Trial‚Äù buttons to stand out (brand color, hover state, rounded corners).

Position CTAs at the bottom of each main section, clearly separated from body text.

üé® DESIGN SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS:
Font Pairing: Use one clear sans-serif font (like Inter, Roboto, or Open Sans) across all pages. Differentiate headers and body with weight, not style.

Icons & Visuals: Use lightweight inline SVG icons (not emojis) to enhance feature sections or benefit lists.

Color Palette:

Primary: Navy (from logo)

Accent: Soft gold or light grey

Background: White or off-white

Button text: High contrast (white on navy)

üß† DESIGN FEEL:
Professional but modern ‚Äî think ‚ÄúApple for golf ops‚Äù

Clear and calm ‚Äî remove visual clutter

A proven solution that feels trustworthy, tested, and tailored for operators

Once you‚Äôve completed this visual overhaul, double-check that the homepage, Features, Use Cases, and FAQ sections all feel consistent in layout and that they elevate the user‚Äôs trust in the product.

You are not just enhancing a website ‚Äî you‚Äôre visually telling the story of a product that‚Äôs solving one of golf‚Äôs most frustrating problems with elegance and simplicity.
