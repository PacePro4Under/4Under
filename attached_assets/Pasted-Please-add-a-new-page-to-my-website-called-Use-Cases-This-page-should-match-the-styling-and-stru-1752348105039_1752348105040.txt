Please add a new page to my website called “Use Cases.”

This page should match the styling and structure of the other pages on my site. It must be mobile-friendly and easy to scroll, with clean visual sectioning — no bullet dumps or clutter. Use subtle icons or styled headings if you want, but do not include any emojis or browser-default visuals.

Use the exact copy below, word-for-word. Do not alter the tone or wording. It is written from a golf operator’s perspective, speaking directly to other operators. The tone is professional, clear, and proven.

Each section below should be styled as its own distinct block or panel:

---

**Public Courses**

Optimize every round — even from first-time visitors.

- Track real-time pace and actual round lengths — no GPS needed.  
- Reduce call-ins, refund demands, and bad reviews.  
- Give marshals live data to defuse tense pace-of-play conversations.  
- See which tee times or time windows run long and adjust scheduling accordingly.

---

**Private & Member Clubs**

Set the tone for your club culture.

- Identify members or groups who consistently fall behind.  
- Use data to support pace policies and maintain fairness.  
- Help starters and marshals deliver a consistent first-tee experience.  
- Reinforce pace expectations without confrontation.

---

**Tournaments & Events**

No more guessing who’s behind.

- Shotgun format support lets you see every group’s location and pace.  
- Know when a flight is falling behind — and why.  
- Use checkpoint logs to issue timely warnings with credibility.  
- Export post-event pace reports to sponsors, organizers, or players.

**For Every Course**

You don’t need GPS, a tablet budget, or a data analyst.

- 4Under was built by golf pros for real-world operations.  
- It works from a phone, tablet, or desktop — and empowers any staff member, young or old.  
- Whether your goal is revenue, reviews, reputation, or all three — pace is central to success.  
- And now it’s measurable, trackable, and fixable.
