What 4Under Does — In Plain Terms

Intro Paragraph:

You know the drill:
	•	The tee sheet’s packed.
	•	Golfers are calling the shop about slow play.
	•	Your marshal has a radio, but no proof.
	•	You’re relying on gut, memory, and guesswork.

4Under changes that. It gives your team real-time visibility, structure, and reporting to manage pace of play with confidence — and ditch the pen and paper once and for all.
